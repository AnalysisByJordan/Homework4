In this file, I am working with a dataset of counties within the US, 
and their various attributes (population, income per capita, college graduate rates, etc.)
Using numpy, pandas, and matplot libraries, I explore the data by mapping income per capita
with college graduate rates, and diving into the statistical correlation of these two variables 
using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, as well as fitting a linear regression model to the data. 
Finally, I create visualizations of the dataframe
